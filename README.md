Java is a powerful, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle. It uses the principle “write once, run anywhere” with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java supports OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. It is widely used for web development, desktop applications, mobile apps (Android), enterprise software, and cloud solutions. Java provides strong memory management, security features, and a rich API library. Its portability, robustness, and scalability make it highly popular among developers. With frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, Java remains essential for building secure, distributed, and high-performance applications worldwide.
